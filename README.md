Now comes the main point...
# What does this Moviebia app do?
Moviebia provides users with movie recommendations based on past users' ratings as well as their own ratings.
Users can find new movies based on their favourite genres as well as the app wide highly rated movies.
This also simultaneously trains the model with new ratings from the users.
But this does not end here....the users can also earn money by rating their favourite movies.
We offer users tokens on rating the movie which can then be redeemed once they reach a certain threshold value.
The user can rate limited number of movies in a specified period of time.
They can redeem it in the form of cryptocurrency for which they need to connect their Solana wallet with the app using their public key.
They are rewarded with SOL on redeemption of tokens which they can spend wherever they want.
This a very basic implementation as it took too much of time to implement such gigantic technologies in a single app.

# How can the app makers earn?
We can earn by integrating ads with our platform. 
The moviemakers can also promote their upcoming movies on our platform in exchange of revenue.
As the app grows the recommendation model grows stronger resulting in benefit of the makers.
We can integrate the option for users to buy the movies suggested to them and also they find interesting.
Along with that we can also interact with ticketing website which will allow users to buy tickets for upcoming movies.
This can turn into an entire environment revolving around digital entertainment.

# Scope for improvement
We can implement various security feature in our app.
The user can be offered extra tokens for completing certain kind of milestones on Moviebia.
We can introduce our own cross chain swapping protocol to power the app and remove any dependencies.
